## UX

[Responsive Views of Home Page] (https://github.com/Natte-Z/amazon/blob/ea1d50af645b4124b073ad029948c763ae888d63/assets/images/Responsive.png)

### Users 
Expected users of the website include customers, people that are looking for a new foot specialist and that are just looking for some relaxation in their life. 

### User Stories
1. A person user wants to learn more about foot therapy sessions in Stockholm, what services include and price ranges.
2. An employee wants to understand how the services are presented to their customers to know what they are expecting (also time wise).
3. A customer wants to see how the company is portrayed on the market and book appointments. 

### Design
- Colour scheme consists of four colours
    - Rose Gold: ![#bd8c7d]
    - Soft Gold: ![#d1bfa7]
    - Silver: ![#8e8e90]
    - Onyx: ![#49494b]
The colours represent a modern, but not too aggressive colour scheme that goes hand in hand with the pictures taken from the salong.
- Font families include:
    - Montserra : used mostly throughout the website
    - Lora: used for header & footer; headlines

### Mockups
The homepage is a single page with a navigation bar that helps the users to find what they are looking for quickly and different features that will be further explained in the next chapter. Figma was used for wireframes that you can see here.
